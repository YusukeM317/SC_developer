# Identity-Service Pattern
## Context
The Identity-Service Pattern is applicable whenever digital identities and their associated pseudonyms should be managed in a decentralized manner. 

``Applies to: [X] EOSIO    [X] Ethereum    [ ] Hyperledger Fabric``

## Problem
The objective of the Identity-Service Pattern is to enable decentralized identity management to overcome challenges related to accountability and liability issues in distributed ledgers. The problem that the Identity-Service Pattern aims to solve is that on public distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum-based or EOSIO-based distributed ledgers, pseudonyms are often hard to associate with their corresponding real-world entity this may pose a challenge if certain aspects of an identity need to be known as prerequisite for a transaction.   

## Forces
The forces involved in the Identity-Service Pattern are accountability, liability, transparency and privacy. The Identity-Service Pattern enables the attestation of claims regarding the identity of a real-world entity (e.g., the age or address of an individual), this fosters transparency if certain prerequisites are required to proceed with a transaction. Furthermore, accountability and liability is enabled through linking the pseudonyms on the public distributed ledgers to their correspoding real-world entities. As drawback the privacy of the real-world entity is reduced.
