# Identity-Service Pattern
## Context
The Identity-Service Pattern is applicable whenever digital identities and their associated pseudonyms should be managed in a decentralized manner. 

``Applies to: [X] EOSIO    [X] Ethereum    [ ] Hyperledger Fabric``

## Problem
The objective of the Identity-Service Pattern is to enable decentralized identity management to overcome challenges related to accountability and liability issues in distributed ledgers. The problem that the Identity-Service Pattern aims to solve is that on public blockchainsm, such as Ethereum-based or EOSIO-based blockchains, pseudonyms are often hard to associate with their corresponding real-world entity.
